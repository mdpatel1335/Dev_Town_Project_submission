# ‚öîÔ∏è Capture the Flag: Offensive Security in Action

## üîç Cybersecurity Lab Challenge ‚Äî Network Scanning & Exploitation

**üß™ Project Title:** Vulnerability Assessment & Exploitation of a Simulated Target  
**üìò Organized by:** DevTown

---

## üéØ Project Goal

This hands-on project simulates a real-world penetration testing scenario. The objective is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a deliberately insecure virtual machine using standard tools and techniques.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques Used

- **Netdiscover** ‚Äì For network reconnaissance and IP discovery  
- **Nmap** ‚Äì Port scanning, service detection, and OS fingerprinting  
- **Metasploit Framework** ‚Äì Exploitation of known vulnerabilities  
- **Linux Command-Line** ‚Äì For system navigation and information gathering  
- **John the Ripper / Hashcat** ‚Äì For cracking encrypted passwords

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Reconnaissance  
The target IP was discovered using `netdiscover`, allowing identification of the machine on the local network.

### 2. Port & Service Scanning  
An in-depth **Nmap** scan was performed to enumerate open ports and detect services and OS details.

### 3. Vulnerability Detection  
A vulnerable version of the FTP service (**ProFTPD 1.3.3c**) was identified, known to be exploitable.

### 4. Exploitation  
Using the **Metasploit Framework**, an exploit was launched against the FTP service, granting shell access to the system.

### 5. Post-Exploitation  
Once inside the system, files like `/etc/passwd` were examined to gather user information. Cracking tools such as **John the Ripper** and **Hashcat** were discussed for further credential attacks.
